# Restaurant_PNL_Analysis

The analysis examines a restaurant's P&L statement by looking at:

- Total profit/loss
- Average change in profit/loss per month
- The greatest increase in profit month over month
- The greatest decrease in profit month over month

The Python script also outputs a .txt file with the summary of the analysis.
